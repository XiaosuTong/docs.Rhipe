## STL+ Fitting ##

### Modeling and Diagnostics ###

Seasonal-Trend decomposition procedure based on Loess (STL)[Cleveland et al, 1990] is a decomposition
method for time series data analysis. Each observation in the time series is decomposed into three 
parts: the trend component, the seasonal component, and the remainder component. The long term change
in the time series is captured by the trend component. A cyclical pattern is reflected in the seasonal
component. The residuals, the remaining variation, are the remainder component.

STL+ is an advanced version of original STL procedure, which is introduced by Ryan Hafen. STL+ added 
several new feature such as capability to handle missing value, local quadratic fitting for trend 
and seasonal components, and adding multiple frequency components, and so forth. In R the package 
for STL+ is called `stl2` which can be installed as following:

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("stl2", "hafen")
```

#### Experiment 1 ####

The first STL+ model we are going to build is setting parameters as following:
`t.window`= 495, `t.degree`= 2, `s.window`= 77, `s.degree`= 1, `inner`= 10, `outer`= 0. So we plan 
to get local linear fit for the seasonal component and local quadratic fit for the trend component.
The fitting span for trend component is about 40% of all observations, and span for seasonal component
is about 75% of all yearly cycles.

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
map <- expression({
  lapply(seq_along(map.values), function(r) {
    tmp <- map.values[[r]]
    month <- c("Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","June","July","Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")
    tmp$month <- factor(tmp$month, levels = month)
    tmp <- tmp[order(tmp$year, tmp$month),]
    tmp$factor <- factor(
      rep(rep(paste("Period", 1:9), c(rep(144,8),84))), 
      levels=paste("Period", c(9:1))
    )
    tmp$time <- c(1:1236)
    tmp$time2 <- c(rep(0:143,8), 0:83)
    ylab <- "Maximum Temperature (degrees centigrade)"
    stl.fit <- stl2(
      x = tmp$tmax, 
      t = tmp$time, 
      n.p = 12, 
      s.window = 77, 
      s.degree = 1, 
      t.window = 495, 
      t.degree = 2, 
      inner = 10, 
      outer = 0
    )$data
    stl.fit <- cbind(tmp, stl.fit)
    trellis.device(postscript, 
      file  = paste("./tmp/stl.1.strend+seasonal", map.keys[[r]], "ps", sep = "."), 
      color = TRUE, 
      paper = "legal"
    )  
    b <- xyplot( raw ~ time2 | factor,
      data = stl.fit,
      xlab = list(label = "Month", cex = 1.2),
      ylab = list(label = ylab, cex = 1.2),
      main = list(label = paste("Station", map.keys[[r]], sep = " "), cex = 1.5),
      layout = c(1,9),
			aspect= 0.06,
			strip = FALSE,
      xlim = c(0, 143),
      scales = list(
        y = list(relation = 'same', tick.number = 4, alternating = TRUE), 
        x = list(at = seq(0, 143, by = 12), relation = 'same')
      ),
      panel = function(x, y, subscripts,...) {
        panel.abline(v = seq(0,145, by = 12), color = "lightgrey", lty = 3, lwd = 0.5)
        panel.xyplot(
          x = x, 
          y = y, 
          type = "p", 
          col = "#0080ff", 
          pch = 16, 
          cex = 0.5, ...
        )
        panel.xyplot(
          x = stl.fit[subscripts,]$time2, 
          y = (stl.fit[subscripts,]$trend+stl.fit[subscripts,]$seasonal), 
          type = "l", 
          col = "#ff00ff", 
          lwd=1, ...
        )            
      }
    )
    print(b)
    dev.off()
  })
})
z <- rhwatch(
  map       = map,
  input     = "/tmp/climate/output/tmax.bystation.10",
  output    = "/tmp/climate/output/graph/stl.1.trend+seasonal",
  setup = expression(
    map = {
      library(lattice)
      library(yaImpute, lib.loc = lib.loc)
      library(stl2, lib.loc = lib.loc)
    }
  ),
  mapred    = list( 
    mapred.reduce.tasks = 0, 
    mapred.task.timeout = 0
  ),
  copyFiles = TRUE,
  readback  = FALSE,
)
```

Then we can copy the files from HDFS to local file system by using `rhget` function in RHIPE.

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
rhget("/tmp/climate/output/graph/stl.1.trend+seasonal/_outputs/stl.1.strend+seasonal.030936.ps", "~/")
```

In the time series plot, the trend component plus seasonal component of maximum temperature is 
plotting against month index. The whole time series is chunked into 9 periods. Each of the first
8 periods has 144 monthly observations, the last period has 84 monthly observations. The raw 
observations are drawn with blue points, and the seasonal component plus trend component was 
drawn with purple curve.

#### Experiment 2 ####

The second STL+ model is setting parameters as following:
`t.window`= 617, `t.degree`= 2, `s.window`= 103, `s.degree`= 1, `inner`= 10, `outer`= 0. So we plan 
to get local linear fit for the seasonal component and local quadratic fit for the trend component.
The fitting span for trend component is about 40% of all observations, and span for seasonal component
is about 75% of all yearly cycles.
