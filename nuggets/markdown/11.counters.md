## Using a Counter ##

### Function rhcounter() ###

The function `rhcounter()` is a very useful function that can help us with collecting information during the mapreduce job. There is sometimes 
that when we are collecting key/value pairs, we would also like to count the frequnce of specific key/value pairs that we are interested in. 
`rhcounter(group, name, value)` increments the distributed counter name that belongs to family `group` by `value`. Ideally `group` and `name` 
should be strings, any R object can be sent and it will be converted to its string representation. The next thing that we should be concerned 
with is how to access this counter we defined in a mapreduce job. At the jobtracker webpage, there will be a counter table in job summary page
of each mapreduce job. There is two types of counters can be found in the table, one is default counters. Mapreduce job itself has some default 
job counters, filesystem counters and so forth. Those counters is defined by Hadoop. Another type of counters is user defined. The first column
of the table is the `group`, second column is `name`, and the rest of columns are the frequence counts in map step, reduce step, and total
respectively.

### Airline Data: Download Status ###

When we download the airline data, we can add two counters to assist us in chekcing the downloading status. We just add two more lines in the map
expression we used to have for downloading code:


```r
map <- expression({
  msys <- function(on){
    system(sprintf("wget  %s --directory-prefix ./tmp 2> ./errors", on))
    if(length(grep("(failed)|(unable)", readLines("./errors"))) > 0){
      stop(paste(readLines("./errors"), collapse="\n"))
    }
  }
  lapply(map.values, function(r){
    x = 1986 + r
    on <- sprintf("http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/%s.csv.bz2", x)
    fn <- sprintf("./tmp/%s.csv.bz2",x)
    msys(on)
    system(sprintf('bunzip2 %s', fn))
    rhcounter("FILES", x, 1)
    rhcounter("FILES", "_ALL_", 1)
  })
})
```


For each downloading job, we create a counter, belongs to "FILES" group, with name same as the corresponding year value. And also, we create a overall
cumulative counter which counts the total number of downloading files, which also belongs to "FILES" group, with the name "_ALL_". So we are going to 
have 10 individual counters with count 1 for each, and one total counter with value equal to 10.

### Airline Data: Delay Rate ###

In the Airline data, we have given an example of calculating the delay rate on every day in the dataset. Within this example, we read in blocks
of data and output sequence file with keys are date of a day, values are total number of flights and number of delayed fights. You may have noticed
the first key/value pair has `NA`s as the key, and two zero as the value. 

```r
b <- rhread("/tmp/airline/output/delaybyday")
head(b, 3)
```

```
[[1]]
[[1]][[1]]
[1] NA NA NA

[[1]][[2]]
[1] 0 0


[[2]]
[[2]][[1]]
[1] "1987" "10"   "1"   

[[2]][[2]]
[1] 14759  9067


[[3]]
[[3]][[1]]
[1] "1987" "10"   "2"   

[[3]][[2]]
[1] 14740  8978
```

The reason for appearance of `NA` key/value pairs is that we used `split()` function. If there is no flight information for a day, `split()` will still create
an element which is an empty data frame, with the name as `NA`, in the result list. Previously we remove the `NA` key from the final data frame `results` read
from HDFS to local, but here we are planning to remove the key/value pairs with `NA` before they are saved to HDFS, and collect the rest of key/value pairs as 
usual. At the same time, we also would like to keep recording the number of key/value pairs with `NA`. This can be done as following:
 

```r
map <- expression({
  a <- do.call("rbind", map.values)
  a$delay.sec <- as.vector(a[, 'arrive']) - as.vector(a[, 'sarrive'])
  a <- a[!is.na(a$delay.sec), ]
  a$isdelayed <- sapply(a$delay.sec, function(r) if(r > 0) TRUE else FALSE)
  e <- split(a, list(a$year, a$month, a$day))
  lapply(e,function(r){
    n <- nrow(r)
    numdelayed <- sum(r$isdelayed)
    if (n == 0) {
      rhcounter("SPLITS", "EMPTY", 1)
    }
    else {
      rhcollect(c(unique(r$year), unique(r$month), unique(r$day)), c(n, numdelayed))
    }
  })
})
reduce <- expression(
  pre = {
    sums <- c(0, 0)
  },
  reduce = {
    sums <- sums + apply(do.call("rbind", reduce.values), 2, sum)
  },
  post = { 
    rhcollect(reduce.key, sums) 
  }
)
mapred <- list()
mapred$rhipe_map_buff_size <- 5
z <- rhwatch(
  map      = map,
  reduce   = reduce,
  combiner = TRUE,
  input    = rhfmt("/tmp/airline/output/blocks", type = "sequence"),
  output   = rhfmt("/tmp/airline/output/delaybyday", type = "sequence"),
  mapred   = mapred,
  readback = FALSE
)
```


For `reduce` expression and `rhwatch()`, we do not change anything to keep it the same as the previous. On jobtracker webpage, we can find that besides 
all system counters, there is an counter named `EMPTY` belongs to group `SPLITS` which has 707 in map step. So now we know there are 707 days are not 
included in our final output.

|                  | Counter             | Map       | Reduce    | Total       |
| -----------------| --------------------|----------:|----------:|------------:|
| SPLITS           | EMPTY               | 707       | 0         | 707         | 
| Job Counters     | SLOTS_MILLIS_MAPS   | 0         | 0         | 1,812,399   |
| ...              |...                  |...        |...        | ...         |

Of course we can have multiple counters within same group we defined. For every flight, we defined delay second to be the difference between arriving time
and schedule arriving time. There will be three different situations after taking this difference, positive and zero delay second means delayed flight, 
neigative delay second means arriving in advance, and 'NA' means one of arriving time is missing and so delay second will be `NA` consequently. Now we 
define a flight is delayed only if the delay second is greater or equal to 15 mins. At the same time, we do want to keep the record about how many flights
are arriving in advance, how many are arriving right on time, and how many are delayed less than 15 mins. `rhcounter()` will be a good helper for this task.


```r
map <- expression({
  a <- do.call("rbind", map.values)
  a$delay.sec <- as.vector(a[, 'arrive']) - as.vector(a[, 'sarrive'])
  rhcounter("DELAY", "NA", sum(is.na(a$delay.sec)))
  a <- a[!is.na(a$delay.sec), ]
  a$isdelayed <- sapply(a$delay.sec, function(r) if(r > 900) TRUE else FALSE)
  rhcounter("DELAY", "ADVANCE", sum(sapply(a$delay.sec, function(r) if(r < 0) TRUE else FALSE)))
  rhcounter("DELAY", "ONTIME", sum(sapply(a$delay.sec, function(r) if(r == 0) TRUE else FALSE)))
  rhcounter("DELAY", "LESS",  sum(sapply(a$delay.sec, function(r) if(r < 900 & r > 0) TRUE else FALSE)))
  e <- split(a, list(a$year, a$month, a$day))
  lapply(e,function(r){
    n <- nrow(r)
    numdelayed <- sum(r$isdelayed)
    if (n == 0) {
      rhcounter("SPLITS", "EMPTY", 1)
    }
    else {
      rhcollect(c(unique(r$year), unique(r$month), unique(r$day)), c(n, numdelayed))
    }
  })
})
```
