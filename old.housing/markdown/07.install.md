## Installation ##

### Installing RHIPE and Dependencies ###

In order to install the `RHIPE` package, we first will download the installation zip file.
All installation step described here is in the R on R session server.


```r
system("wget http://ml.stat.purdue.edu/rhipebin/Rhipe_0.74.0.tar.gz")
```

After successfully downloaded the source zip file to your R working directory on R session server,
we will start to install the `RHIPE`.


```r
install.packages("testthat")
install.packages("rJava")
install.packages("Rhipe_0.74.0.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")
```

The first two installation commands are trying to install two dependencies of `RHIPE`. Sometimes you
may face difficulty of installing `rJava` package, please consult your server administrator for Java
configuration information to successfully install `rJava`.

### Initializing RHIPE ###

Now, you have successfully installed `RHIPE` on R session server. The next two thing you have to do
is to call the `RHIPE` library and initializes it.


```r
library(Rhipe)
rhinit()
```

As a R user, we definitely want to use other useful packages during the `RHIPE` job. So we have to 
create a shared zip file which includes R and all R packages that user has installed on R session 
server. Then every time when we submit a `RHIPE` job, this zip file will be distributed to every 
Hadoop servers and to make sure all of them have the same R and all R packages.


```r
rhmkdir("/shared")
hdfs.setwd("/shared/") 
bashRhipeArchive("RhipeLib")
```

Function `hdfs.setwd()` is used to set a HDFS working directory for all `RHIPE` commands that use the HDFS. 
We used "/shared/" here, but you can use whatever path you like on your HDFS. But make sure this directory
on HDFS has been created. You can use `rhmkdir` function to create a directory on HDFS.
Then `bashRhipeArchive` function is creating an archive on the HDFS with a runner script appropriate for 
running `RHIPE` jobs, and then uploads that archive to the HDFS working directory that we just created
"/shared/".


```r
rhls("/shared/")
```
```
  permission owner      group     size          modtime                    file
1 -rw-rw-rw- tongx supergroup 81.02 mb 2014-06-02 15:55 /shared/RhipeLib.tar.gz       
```

You can check what has been created on HDFS by using `rhls` function. There is a "RhipeLib.tar.gz" 
file created under "/shared/" on HDFS. It is an R distribution loaded with every shared lib file 
that a package R has installed might have used. This tar.gz file basically included R, all R 
packages user have installed on R session server, and all shared lib files that R packages need. 

Finally, every time when the user starts to use `RHIPE` package, the following lines of commands 
should be included.


```r
library(Rhipe)
rhinit()
rhoptions(zips = "/shared/RhipeLib.tar.gz")
rhoptions(runner = "sh ./RhipeLib/library/Rhipe/bin/RhipeMapReduce.sh")
```
